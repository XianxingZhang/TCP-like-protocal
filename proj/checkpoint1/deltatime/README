timer.c: This is for implementing the timer process by using delta list. It will wait for instruction from driver.c to change delta list and it will exit after all Timers expired.

driver.c: This is for giving add/delete request to timer process to change delta list.

How to use:
	1. Compile the program using command "make".
	2. Start the timer process using "timer"
	3. Start the driver process using "driver"

	To give a different change to delta list, change the driver.c program and then compile and re-run it .
