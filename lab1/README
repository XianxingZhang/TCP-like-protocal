  1) [version1] is used to read a binary file and print the size of the file as well as the number of specific string appeared in the file.

  2) Enter the path of [version1], using command "make" to compiler [version1].

  3) use command "./count<input-filename><search-string><output-filename>" to run the   program, remember to put the input file under the same path with [version1].And if the output file exists, the program would overwrite it; if not, one will be created.

  update:
  1) set the limitation: the name of inputfile and outputfile as well as the length of searching string should be 20 bytes or less
  2) check the legality of opening inputfile and writing or creating outputfile.
